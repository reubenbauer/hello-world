Learn Github

Just starting to use GitHub for work.
Will help me with my extreme disorganization. 
I am writing my thesis right now and all of my code is super disorganized. 
Deleting and Adding at the Same Time to see how merging works. 
Also, I want to see what merge errors look like but I am not sure how to do that.
